## Hacktoberfest

This project is very [Hacktoberfest friendly!](https://hacktoberfest.com)

## How to help

This is a shell that is best used to show how to make argon2i work with PHP.

Ideally, open a pull request that improves either:
* the hello-world.php to better use Argon
* Improves my (admittedly terrible) PHP code
* Overall improves the final readability

You can contribute by simply opening a pull request. No tests are required at this time.

If possible, please use Gitpod to launch this, as it'll do the docker building for you.
